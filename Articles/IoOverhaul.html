                <p class="white_text">So, what happened:</p>
                
                <p class="white_text">
                    I was thinking about the way I've implemented file IO in the past and 
                    considering this is not the first time I had to redo the entire thing,
                    it struck me that I should probably start from scratch as I heavily 
                    relied on the C implementation of IO, which is not slow compared to 
                    <code class="code_custom">std::fstream</code> and <code class="code_custom">std::ifstream</code>, 
                    but I knew that I can make it faster, seeing how <code class="code_custom">libfmt</code> 
                    performs, and emphasis on the user to control the buffer size, so I've dome that.
                </p>

                <p class="white_text">
                    The first thing I had to do is to give the ability to the user to get 
                    the underlying stream from the file object. Here's the code for that:
                </p>

                <script src="
                    ../Core/embed.js?target=HackyTeam/HackySTL/blob/cab6347fcea0f34b0001ae1082b8f3643d681609/lib/Io.hpp%23L419-L422
                "></script>

                <p class="white_text">
                    <code class="code_custom">return *this;</code>, what? That's right, I'm returning the
                    <code class="code_custom">*this</code> pointer, which is the file object itself.
                    This is the way I can get the underlying stream from the file object.
                </p>

                <p class="white_text">
                    But why have you inherited from <code class="code_custom">stream</code>? 
                    The answer is, I don't know. It made sense to me when I was implementing it.
                </p>

                <p class="white_text">
                    Now that the user can access the properties of the underlying 
                    stream and essentially screw themselves this means we have to
                    modify the way output and input works. The traditionally 
                    <code class="code_custom">.print()</code> method is now printing
                    into the stream rather than the file. So, in order to do that
                    you have to call the <code class="code_custom">.flush()</code> 
                    method as well. <code class="code_custom">.print()</code> is 
                    implemented as such:
                </p>

                <script src="
                    ../Core/embed.js?target=HackyTeam/HackySTL/blob/cab6347fcea0f34b0001ae1082b8f3643d681609/lib/Io.hpp%23L530-L602
                "></script>

                <p class="white_text">
                    Again, <code class="code_custom">snprintf</code>? Why is that even there if 
                    you said you are going to replace C IO functions? Well, guess what? Implementing
                    IO for buffers is very complicated, even more if you want to do floating point numbers,
                    so I'm instead to use C's buffer IO functions for that which are very fast, the only 
                    bottleneck are actually the files themselves. File descriptors are very slow to manipulate.
                </p>

                <p class="white_text">
                    And the <code class="code_custom">.flush()</code> method is implemented as such:
                </p>

                <script src="
                    ../Core/embed.js?target=HackyTeam/HackySTL/blob/cab6347fcea0f34b0001ae1082b8f3643d681609/lib/Io.hpp%23L439-L463
                "></script>

                <p class="white_text">
                    The <code class="code_custom">.read()</code> is also implemented differently:
                </p>
                
                <script src="
                    ../Core/embed.js?target=HackyTeam/HackySTL/blob/cab6347fcea0f34b0001ae1082b8f3643d681609/lib/Io.hpp%23L465-L528
                "></script>

                <p class="white_text">
                    And I went to implement the file handlers for unix and windows, 
                    fun fact: windows also supports file descriptors, but I went 
                    full on and implemented a windows specific file handler.
